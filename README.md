# autoSlidshow
A short and sweet Python script to automate slide changes in applications without an autoplay feature.

This was created for a children's library program, where the librarian wanted an ebook automatically flipping the pages in the background.

You don't need it for Google Slides or Powerpoint, becasue they have built in features to do the same thing, but if there is an application that cannot automatically scroll through slides or pages, this can be useful.
