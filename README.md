# autoSlidshow
A short and sweet Python script to automate slide changes in applications without an autoplay feature.

It uses PyAutoGui to automatically press the right arrow a set number of times and pause for a set number of seconds on the slide, then press the left arrow the same number of times to loop back to the start.

This was created for a children's library program, where the librarian wanted an ebook automatically flipping the pages in the background.

You don't need it for Google Slides or Powerpoint, becasue they have built in features to do the same thing, but if there is an application that cannot automatically scroll through slides or pages, this can be useful.
